This application is intended to be an introduction to building a rag application. You will need the following if you wish to use this locally: 

1) An OpenAI API Key used for tokenizing documents
   a. I used about 10 large PDFs (roughly 2500-3000 pages total) and it cost about a dollar to re-process a few times.
2) A batch of sample PDFs. Additional file formats may be added in the future.
